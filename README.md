# Attendance-System-using-Facial-Recognition-in-Raspberry-Pi

Attendance is an important part of daily classroom evaluation. At the beginning and ending of 
class, it is usually checked by the teacher, but it may appear that a teacher may miss someone 
or some students answer multiple times. Face recognition-based attendance system is a problem 
of recognizing face for taking attendance by using face recognition technology based on high-definition monitor video and other information technology.


Objective and Scope:
The objective of this process is to create a software that can autonomously mark the attendance 
and store them in a database, this technology aims to upgrade the traditional method of marking 
attendance. The current methods of attendance monitoring are mainly either by speech e.g.: 
Roll Call or smart cards both these systems are extremely vulnerable to proxies. Our Project 
has the potential to eliminate this as it collects the attendance data by the means of facial 
scanning. Unlike the current methods the entries by facial recognition are extremely difficult 
to fake adding a layer of security to the process. The machine mainly comprises of two main 
components namely the camera module and the brains in this project we have decided to use 
raspberry pi as the processor because of its compact size, ready and cheap availability and the 
pi camera module, the language used is python. The Goal of our project is simple, to create an 
attendance monitoring system that uses facial recognition to record and mark attendance in the 
database that should be accessible remotely. As the system uses facial recognition it is much 
more secure and accurate in comparison to the current methods and virtually does not consume 
any time as it can work autonomously. As the system is a type of calm technology it can also 
be used for security and for entering places such as classrooms as it can segregate authorized 
personnel from the unauthorized ones and send an alert to the admin should an unauthorized 
person enter the clas
